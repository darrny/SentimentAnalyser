Instructions 🚀

1.	Open the Notebook
	-	Navigate to the Sentiment Analyser Notebook.
	-	Run the code blocks sequentially.
2.	Steps to Explore Sentiment Analysis:
	-	The notebook processes a dataset of Amazon reviews, tokenizes the text, and applies the VADER Sentiment Analysis tool.
	-	Sentiment scores (compound, pos, neu, and neg) are calculated for each review.
	-	Results are visualized to identify patterns and trends.
3.	Key Outputs:
	-	Plots:
	-	Distribution of sentiment scores by ratings.
	-	Common words used in 1-star and 5-star reviews.
  -	Correlation between text length and sentiment.
	-	Analysis:
	-	Discrepancies between sentiment and user ratings.
	-	Statistical summaries such as average ratings and sentiment mismatches.

Project Highlights 📊

  -	Sentiment-Rating Correlation: Positive correlation observed between sentiment scores and star ratings, meaning higher sentiment scores often align with higher ratings.
  -	Common Words: Words like “great” and “love” are frequent in positive reviews, while negative reviews feature words such as “poor” or “worst”.
  -	 Mismatch Analysis: Cases identified where sentiment scores conflict with the star ratings, often revealing nuances or limitations in sentiment analysis tools.

Limitations ⚠️

  -	Context Understanding: The VADER tool struggles with sarcasm, context, and nuanced language.
	-	Focus on English: Analysis is limited to English text reviews only.

Future Improvements 🌟

  -	Incorporate topic modeling to explore themes across reviews.
	-	Compare performance with other sentiment analysis tools or models.
	-	Expand analysis to include product categories for more specific insights.
