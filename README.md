📊 Project Highlights

  -	Sentiment-Rating Correlation: Positive correlation observed between sentiment scores and star ratings, meaning higher sentiment scores often align with higher ratings.
  -	Common Words: Words like “great” and “love” are frequent in positive reviews, while negative reviews feature words such as “poor” or “worst”.
  -	 Mismatch Analysis: Cases identified where sentiment scores conflict with the star ratings, often revealing nuances or limitations in sentiment analysis tools.

⚠️ Limitations

  -	Context Understanding: The VADER tool struggles with sarcasm, context, and nuanced language.
	-	Focus on English: Analysis is limited to English text reviews only.

🌟 Future Improvements
